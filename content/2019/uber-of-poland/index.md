A couple of years ago, I was visiting a friend in Warsaw, Poland. Having a local
guide meant that I could get a glimpse at young people's lifestyle at the time.
One thing I noticed was that they had no Uber, and Taxis were quite expensive.
It turns out that most young people used a community-operated service called
"Nightrider" instead.

What fascinated me about it was the way the service was organized: entirely
through WhatsApp. You would text a number and get a confirmation. In the
background, your request would be handled by a central operator who posts your
location and the number of riders to a group chat with all the drivers. The one
that was free and close would react with a thumbs-up emoji, and everyone else knew that
the ride was taken.

It's a super low-tech solution. Basically, they were piggy-backing on an existing
communication network. There was no website and no sign-up form, but it still
worked.

## In Defense of Clones

Uber and Lyft can't be everywhere from the start. While they grow their
business, others have the opportunity to be faster. There's an Uber clone in
China ([DiDi](https://didichuxing.com])) and one in Africa and the Middle East
([Careem](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/)) and basically one for every
[country](https://gett.com/il/)

[the](https://taxi.yandex.ru/) [world](https://www.gojek.com/). The western
world rarely speaks about them, but they handle millions of customers. While
they might start as an exact copy of their well-known counterparts, some of them
end up providing better service, because they can cater to the special needs of
a local market.

## The Offline Internet

Another example of radical startup spirit is Cuban's version of the internet.
You see, Internet in Cuba is _very expensive_. [1 MB costs 0.1
CUC](https://blog.fonoma.com/mobile-internet-cuba-f4e9a66c69d9), but people only
earn like 30 CUC per month. Impossible to pay for average people.

But, of course, [they found a
way](https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/cuba-connectify-connecifai-internet-etecsa.html).

Today, most of the public internet runs through ad-hoc Wifi they call
_Conectifai_ (named after the most popular hardware provider,
[Connectify](https://www.connectify.me/)); entirely managed by private "data
brokers". This way, people keep connected with friends and family outside of
Cuba.

Popular shows and music get distributed through a USB drive. They call it _El
Paquete Semanal_, which means "The Weekly Package." Around 80% of the population
get this entertainment package. Here's a [nice
documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpegk0V-hEw) about it.
Turns out those "offline networks" are called
[sneakernets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) and they are quite
popular:

> In 2017, the data of the first black hole image was recorded by the Event
> Horizon Telescope and **had to be flown on hundreds of hard drives for
> processing**. [...] Each of the Event Horizon Telescope's Mark6 recorder
> receives digital data at a rate of 16 Gigabits/sec. [...] That data is then
> stored on from 1,000 to 2,000 of helium-filled 8TB hard drives, which amounts
> to about 7 petabytes (PB) of data.

## People always find a way

With creativity, you can provide great service even if the odds are against you.
I salute to this entrepreneurial passion. The Cubans have a word for it:
_resolver_, which means "we'll figure it out". That's the true hacker spirit.

I'm pretty sure there are more examples from other local markets and I would be
curious to hear about them.
