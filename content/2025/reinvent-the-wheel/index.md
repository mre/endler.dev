One of the most dangerous pieces of advice given to engineers is to not reinvent the wheel. 

The advice probably comes from a good place, but is typically given by two groups of people: 
- those who tried to invent a wheel themselves and know how hard it is
- those who never tried to invent a wheel and blindly follow the advice

Either way, both positions lead to an atmosphere where curiosity and exploration gets discouraged.
I'm glad that some people didn't follow that advice for we owe them many of the conveniences of modern life.
We have much better wheels today than 4500â€“3300 BCE when the first wheel was invented.
It was also *crucially* important that wheels got reinvented throughout civilizations and cultures.

tool, protocol, service, technology, or other invention you're personally interested in.

## Inventing Wheels Is Learning

To *really* understand something on a fundamental level, you have to be able to implement a toy version yourself. 
It doesn't matter if it's any good; you can throw it away later.

In Computer Science, for example, there are many concepts that are commonly assumed to be beyond the abilities of mere mortals:
protocols, cryptography, and web servers come to mind.

More people should know these things work. 
And therefore I think people should not be afraid to recreate them. 

## Reinvent Simple Things Yourself

Too often, fundamental things are taken for granted. 
For example strings or paths are super complicated concepts in programming.
I think it's a great exercise to implement a string or a path library yourself
if you're interested in how they work.

Even if nobody ends up using your work, I bet you'll learn a lot. For example:

- There is an infinite complexity in everyday things. 
- Building something that even a single other person finds useful is a humbling experience. 
- Humans like you created these abstractions. They are not perfect and you can make different tradeoffs in your own design. 

On the last point, everything is a tradeoff and there are dozens, sometimes hundreds of footguns with every toy problem. 
Along the way, you will have to make decisions about correctness, simplicity, functionality, scalability, performance, resource usage, portability, and so on.

Your solution can be great in some of these things, but not all of them and not for all users.

Which tradeoffs are **you** willing to make?

## Reasons for Reinventing the Wheel

There are many great reasons to reinvent the wheel: 

* Build a better wheel (for some definition of better)
* Learn how wheels are made 
* Teach others about wheels
* Appreciate wheels more
* Appreciate the inventors of wheels
* Be able to change wheels or fix them when they break
* Learn the tools needed to make wheels along the way
* Learn a tiny slice of what it means to build a larger system (such as a vehicle)
* Help someone in need of a very special wheel. Maybe for a wheelchair?

Who knows? The wheel you come up with might not be the best use for a car, but maybe for a... skateboard or a bike?
Or you fail building a nicer wheel, but you come up with a better way to test wheels along the way.
Heck, your wheel might not even be meant for transportation at all! 
It might be a potter's wheel, "a machine used in the shaping (known as throwing) of clay into round ceramic ware" [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel).
You might end up building a totally different kind of wheel like a steering wheel or a flywheel.

## Reuse vs Reinvent 

There is one other benefit for reinventing the wheel:
It is one of the fastest ways to level up as a programmer... but only if you don't give up before you end up with a working version of what you tried to explore.
If you jump between projects too often, you will not get to the hard parts of the problem, which require making tradeoffs.

Entire careers are made of people inventing wheels.
We have different names for them: "scientists", "entrepreneurs", "inventors", to name a few.
We need more people who are bold enough to try to reinvent the wheel.
If you never tried to put your knowledge to the test, how would you ever know enough about your field to advance it?

Of course, don't disregard the works of others -- study their work and learn from their mistakes.
PLEASE DO reinvent the wheel... unless you need a robust production-ready wheel today. In that case, just buy one and move on.

So, with all of the above, here's my advice: 

**Reinvent for insight. Reuse for impact.**
