Paolo was a plumber.

People knew him as a reliable and thorough craftsman.
He fixed the pipes in his small town and made a good living doing so.

One day, his friend Mario, another plumber, told him that he bought a plumbing machine.
Paolo was intrigued. He asked how it worked.

"It's magical!", said Mario.
I point it at the broken spot, and it fixes the problem in no time!
Paolo asked if he could watch the machine work and Mario agreed.

The next day, Paolo and Mario took the machine to a house with a broken pipe.
Paolo watched as Mario pointed the machine at the pipe.
"Beep boop" and the machine started to work, and quick.
Within minutes, the pipe was fixed.
Paolo was amazed.

"Soon no one will need plumbers anymore," said Mario.
"I can already do the work of ten plumbers with this machine!"

That night, Paolo couldn't sleep.
He thought about his job and how it might change.
He loved being a plumber and helping people.
But what if machines really took over?
Maybe it was time for him to find a new job. 

Within a few weeks, Paolo's phone stopped ringing.
People were calling Mario instead because he did a quicker, cheaper job.
Some of Paolo's old customers even told him that Paolo was "old-fashioned" and "out of touch."  

Paolo got really worried.

In the past none of his customers ever complained about his work.
He always took time to do things right.
He would check every joint, seal every pipe, and make sure everything was perfect before leaving.
Sometimes he noticed other problems that needed fixing such as a leaking faucet, 
and he would offer to fix those too.

Then, one day, he got a call from a customer.
It was an emergency.
The pipes in a restaurant were leaking and they needed help fast.
Paolo rushed to the restaurant and found a big mess.
He quickly got to work, using his tools and skills to fix the problem.
The owner was very grateful.
"We just got it fixed the other day!"
When Paolo asked who did the work, the owner said it was Mario.

From that day on, more and more people called Paolo.
They all had problems after working with Mario and the machine.
On closer inspection of the damage, Paolo kept finding the same mistakes:
Pipes not properly sealed, joints not aligned correctly, leaks that were only temporarily fixed with instant glue
-- it was a messy job.
From time to time the machine would even add extra parts that seemingly had no purpose.
For example, it would add another pipe that ended nowhere, or a valve that didn't connect to anything.
These parts would not cause any problems, but were hallmarks of bad craftsmanship.
One time Paolo even noticed that the machine decided to paint a pipe in bright pink and use a glittery sealant for now good reason.
Over time, Paolo noticed the signs that the machine did the job. 

Paolo realized that while the machine was fast, it wasn't perfect.
He called Mario and told him what he found.
Mario knew about the issues: "I told it to fix it, but it didn't work right. Even when I asked it multiple times and when I was very polite." 

Paolo asked why he didn't just fix it himself.
"I can't." Mario said, "I don't know how to do it without the machine."
Paolo was shocked.
After all, Mario was a reputable plumber before he got the machine; he certainly knew his trade.
Now he was relying on a machine that didn't always work.
Worse, Mario said he didn't own the machine, but that it was rented from a Big Company far away.
The rent was cheap in the beginning, but now it was getting more expensive.

But Paolo also realized that Mario wasn't the only one.
Many plumbers were now using machines to do the work for them and many new plumbers were learning to use machines instead of tools.

And it wasn't just plumbers: electricians, carpenters, and other tradespeople were all relying on machines to do their jobs now.
The machines caused problems, but the Big Company promised that they would fix everything
and that it would get better with time.
They kept updating the machines and gave them fancy names, but the problems remained.

Paolo felt sad and hopeless.
What could he do?

He decided to take action.

He started a campaign in his town: he explained how important it was to have skilled plumbers who could fix problems properly.
He showed people the difference between quick fixes and real solutions.
Slowly, people began to understand.
Most of them only after they had problems with the machines.

Soon, Paolo's phone was ringing off the hook again.
He was back to being the most trusted plumber in town.
He had to fix some of the mess the machines created, but his customers appreciated his work.
On the side, Paolo also taught Mario how to fix pipes properly again.
He showed him how to use tools instead of relying on the machine.
Mario soon was back to being a skilled plumber.
"Thank you, I really missed the feeling of actually fixing things," he said.

When Mario asked him why he never gave up, 
Paolo just smiled and said: "I just really like plumbing."
