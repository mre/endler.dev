I spent *years* telling myself typography doesn't matter.
"It's just letters on paper," I'd say.
But the truth is, I hate bad typography.

Most people claim to appreciate good design — right until they reach for Comic Sans to make their wedding invitations "fun."
They see a beautifully designed magazine spread and say it looks "nice."

Then there's people like me who can't stop caring.

Here's the truth: you can't **NOT** care about typography. 
Eventually you've got to pick a font (or choose the default).
Your choice, just like clothing, reveals a lot about you. 
Whether you intend to or not, you're making a statement.

## Personal Taste 

*Everything* in this world is somebody's obsession.
Sneakers.
Mechanical keyboards.
Vintage bottle caps.

When you spend enough time with anything, patterns emerge.

Watch 10,000 movies and suddenly you're analyzing Dutch angles and obsessing over color grading.
You notice pacing issues that others don't.
Congratulations!
Movies are forever ruined for you.

Once you start seeing nuance, you can't unsee it.
You've developed taste.
Very specific, personal taste.

To outsiders, it's incomprehensible why you'd spend an ungodly amount of time researching camera models or why you know the name of [that random student in the 'Social Network'](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

Picking up on the finer details is the first step towards developing something more substantive than mere preference—it's the foundation of good taste.

## Good Taste

Just because you have personal preferences doesn't mean you have good taste.
Personal preferences are just an opinion.

I believe good taste is recognizing quality in things which goes beyond personal preference. 
It's understanding how *someone else* expresses their personal taste through deliberate choices
and recognizing the context and how it relates to the subculture they feel part of.
Good taste often feels natural; effortless.

What connects good taste and expertise is attention to detail.
Both come from deep care about something.
Both require understanding why each element matters.
Both demand knowing precisely what effect a decision has.

Simply put: people with good taste **care**.

And they care enough to invest the time to become experts in their field.
Or perhaps it's the experts who care enough to develop good taste?

Take Willie Nelson's guitar, "Trigger," a 1969 Martin N-20.
To most, it's just a worn-down chunk of wood with a hole in it.
But after 10,000 performances, it's developed a sound that can't be replicated.
The same repairman has been maintaining it since 1977.
That's some dedication to craftsmanship if there ever was one.

And the central piece is control.

Willie **demands** control over every aspect of his sound.
Because the details are what makes the whole.
Willie **obsesses** over details.

Is it Willie Nelson who beat "Trigger" into a unique guitar?
Or is it the guitar that soothened Willie's sound? 
Would both be equally great without the other?
Doesn't matter. They aged together and they'll die together.

Good taste is caring enough to demand control over the details that **don't** matter
—because that's all that matters.

To truly develop good taste, you must first learn from masters.
Only then can you dismiss their advice and find your own voice.
Picasso learned to draw like an old master by 14, only to reinvent art as he got older.

It takes one to know one.
And there is no shortcut...

## You Can't Buy Good Taste

There's a common misconception that good taste can simply be purchased.
At least that's what marketing wants you to believe.

Buying an Apple device doesn't prove you have good taste. 
Millions own Apple devices.
To most, it's just a status symbol.
That purchase doesn't make you an artist any more than buying Air Jordans makes you a pro basketball player. 

In fact, people with good taste develop an aversion to brands. 
That's because strong brands tend to kill great products with time.

The cycle goes like this: 

1. Someone creates something brilliant.
2. Early adopters discover it and can't stop talking about it. 
3. Popularity grows.
4. The company cuts corners to meet demand.
5. Quality suffers.
6. Early adopters abandon the product. 

Most products target the average consumer.
So most products settle for mediocrity.
Since we can't be experts in everything, we trust the advice from other people only to wonder why things feel "off" sometimes.
We *sense* sub-par quality but can't articulate why, which is a bit tragic if you ask me.

Or maybe it's fine and I'm just overthinking it?
What if there is no such thing as good taste?

## Does Good Taste Exist?

I don't think there's a definitive answer!
It might all just be very subjective in the end.

At least it gets harder to develop a truly *unique* taste nowadays. 
We don't get in touch with the rough and the uncomfortable anymore.
But without exposure to things we *don't* like we can't turn them into things we *do*. 
Most people didn't like their first coffee; it's an acquired taste.
But if we don't push past our comfort zone, taste can't evolve. 

Maybe good taste is just an illusion after all.
Maybe we just stroke our egos by pretending to have good taste.
It's all just one giant echo chamber.
Then again, hasn't always been this way?

## What Now? 

On one side, I think taste matters deeply but on the other side I say it's all subjective and possibly irrelevant.
How does that fit together? 

Both can be true at the same time.
I think good taste is a personal journey and you should not stop caring.
In fact, if you do stop caring, that's how you end up with low-quality products and mediocre work.

There's profound joy in learning to distinguish the good from the bad.
It leads to owning better tools, making smarter purchases.
You discover different facets of personality in other people.
We create strong bonds when we nerd out over coffee grinders.
All those seemingly irrelevant details matter!
All of that quirkiness brings color. 
It's part of the human experience.

So get yourself out there and try something different for a change.

I believe everyone should have at least one thing they irrationally obsess about.
A domain they truly call themselves an expert in, no matter how small.
It makes for a richer life.

When you create products for others, tasteful decisions become all the more important.
It's as personal as it gets, just like your signature or choice of words.
It shows who you are and where you belong. 

Try to develop good taste in the things that matter to you.

Experiment and learn from others to develop your own taste.
Or just steal from someone else and adapt over time.
[That's what Picasso did, at least.](https://creativityclasses.com/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/)

I've been honing this blog design for two decades and I'm far from done.
With each version, though, I try to express my ideas more clearly.
And it turns out my design language becomes *simpler*.

Part of it is just great typography and negative space. 
Perhaps a little color and the whole thing comes alive.

I don't know if my personal taste has evolved into good taste, but I can explain *why* I made every decision the way I did. 
And I think that's a damn good start.

Good taste begins with noticing the finer details others miss.
