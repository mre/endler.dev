I spent *years* telling myself typography doesn't matter.  
"It's just letters on paper," I'd say.  
But the truth is, I hate bad typography.

No matter how hard you try, you can’t **NOT** care about typography.  
Eventually, you have to pick a font (or use the default). 
Your choice — like clothing — says something about you.  
Whether you mean to or not, you’re making a statement if you reach for Comic Sans for your playful wedding invitation. 

But what exactly does it mean when people say "you have good taste"?
Is that a skill you can learn?
When does taste turn into an obsession? 
How deep does the rabbit-hole go?

## Personal Taste

*Everything* is somebody's obsession.  
Sneakers. Mechanical keyboards. Vintage bottle caps.

Spend enough time with anything, and the patterns start to emerge.

Watch 10,000 movies and you’ll start analyzing Dutch angles and obsessing over color grading.  
You start notice subtle issues in pacing.  
Congratulations! Movies are forever ruined for you. 

Once you start seeing nuance, you can’t unsee it.  
You’ve developed taste.  
Oddly specific, personal taste, that is.

To outsiders, it’s beyond comprehension why you’d want to spend years researching camera models or why you should know the name of [a random extra in *The Social Network*](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

That's the danger-zone.
If you never leave this stage, you're just a guy with an opinion.

But also: picking up on the finer details is the first step toward something more than just preference — it’s the foundation for *good* taste.

## Good Taste

Having preferences isn’t the same as having good taste.  
Preferences are just opinions.

Good taste is about *recognizing quality outside your own preferences*.  
You don't have to share their taste, but you acknowledge it. 
It’s understanding how someone expresses their viewpoint through deliberate choices, in their context and their subculture.  
Good taste feels natural. Effortless.

## Expertise

There is some connection between good taste and expertise.
What links good taste and expertise is attention to detail.  
Both come from caring deeply.  
Both require knowing *why* things work.  
Both demand awareness of the effect each decision has.

People with good taste **care** more about details than the average person.
And often they care enough to become experts.
You can't just be a bystander, you have to participate.
One informs the other: experts care enough to develop good taste and good taste shows expertise. 

Take Willie Nelson’s guitar, "Trigger" — a 1969 Martin N-20.  
To most, it’s just a worn-down chunk of wood.  
It might equally be the guitar of a busker.
But after 10,000 performances, it has a sound that can’t be replicated.  
The same repairman’s maintained it since 1977.
That’s dedication to craftsmanship if I’ve ever seen it.

The central motivation is control.

Willie **demands** control over every part of his sound.  
Willie **obsesses** over details.
Because the details are what control the sound. 

But here's what's interesting:
Is it Willie who shaped the guitar, or the guitar that softened Willie’s voice?  
Would they be equally great without each other?  
They aged together. They'll die together.

Good taste is caring enough to control the details that **don’t** matter — because that’s where the magic is.

Good taste means knowing what you can take away.
Without Willie, Trigger would just be a chunk of wood.
Others might focus on great optics and known brands.
That's irrelevant: sound is not about the looks. 
Good taste means developing intuition on what to focus on. 
Good taste means knowing what matters.

## You Can’t Just Buy Good Taste

There's a myth that good taste can be bought.  
If that worked, you'd know by now, because many people tried, but none succeeded.
It's just what marketing wants you to believe.

Buying an Apple device doesn’t mean you have good taste.  
Millions own them.
For many, it’s just a status symbol.  
Apple helps you think different in the same way that Air Jordans help you become a pro athlete. 

People with good taste often *avoid* brands.
Brands kill great products with time.

The cycle goes like this:

1. Someone creates something great.  
2. Early adopters rave about it.  
3. Popularity grows.  
4. Corners get cut to meet demand.  
5. Quality drops.  
6. Early adopters move on.

Most products are built for the average customer.  
So most products settle for average quality.  
We can’t be experts in everything, so we trust what others say — then wonder why most products suck. 

We *sense* when something’s sub-par, even if we can’t put our finger on it. 
That’s a little tragic.

Or maybe I’m overthinking it.  
Maybe good taste itself is an illusion. 
It might all just be subjective in the end.

## Does Good Taste Exist?

I don’t think there’s a definitive answer.  
But it’s hard to develop unique taste today.  
We avoid discomfort.
And without exposure to things we *don’t* like, we can’t discover things we *do*.

For example, most people didn’t like their first coffee.  
It's an acquired taste.

If we get too comfortable, we stop to evolve. 
And without growth, taste stays superficial and shallow.

## What Now?

On one side, I think taste matters deeply.  
On the other, it’s all subjective and possibly irrelevant.

Both can be true!
It depends on the context.

There’s joy in learning to tell the good from the bad.  
It leads to better tools and smarter choices.  
If you stop to care, you will be surrounded by mediocre things.
Good taste is a personal journey.  

We bond over espresso grinders and film stocks.  
Those weird little details matter?  
They make life more colorful.
It's part of the human experience.

Everyone should have at least one thing they irrationally obsess over.  
Something they know inside and out.  
It makes life richer.

When you create for others, your taste becomes visible — it's like a signature or a voice.  
It shows who you are and what you care about. 

So experiment. Learn from others.  
Or just steal and refine as you go.  
[That’s what Picasso did at least.](https://creativityclasses.com/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/)

I’ve been refining this blog’s design for two decades, and I’m still at the beginning. 
But with each new version, I get a little better at explaining what matters to me. 

Turns out, my design language keeps getting *simpler*.  
Now it's mostly about typography and negative space.  

I don’t know what it says about my personal taste. 
But I can explain to you *why* I made every decision.
And that’s a damn good place to start.

Good taste begins with noticing the finer details others miss.
If you want to develop good taste, learn to see the details in the things you care about.
