The year is 2015 and I realize that something is very wrong with me.
Maybe I stared at a poster or perhaps I saw a shop sign, but for the first time in my life,
I realize that I hate bad typography.

Now, a lot of people subconsciously like good typography (or at least that's what they think
until you see them reach for Comic Sans whenever they need a "cute" font for their printout).

If you see a great logo or a nicely designed magazine article, you can't help but
think "oh golly, that's neat!" without really knowing *why*. It's just... "well done."

On the other end of the spectrum you have people like me, who *obsess* over typography,
even though I actively **refused** to care about it for a long time.
I told myself that it doesn't matter which font I pick.
It's just letters on a piece of paper.
But also: you can't **NOT** pick a font -- and your choice *will* say something about yourself;
about your taste.
It's like fashion: like it or not, you're communicating through your clothing style.
People who care will take notice.
The question is just whether you remain oblivious to it.
I myself couldn't bring myself to pick a random font, so I had to study fonts whether I wanted to or not. 

Anyways.

What I really asked myself is... 

## What IS Good Taste?

Every single thing in this world is something some people obsess about. 
Whether it be sneakers, mechanical keyboards, crown caps, or toy cars.
*Everything* is someone's hobby.

When you spend enough time on anything, you start to see the patterns.

Take movies for example.
Once you've seen 10,000 movies, you start to notice dutch angles, you obsess over dynamic range and color grading, pacing, lighting – it never stops. 
Congratulations! Movies have been forever ruined for you.

What happened is that you developed a very specific taste for what makes a great movie.
To an outsider, it's extremely hard to comprehend why you spend an ungodly amount of time
researching the camera model used in a specific movie or why you know the name of the actor
who played [that student in the Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

It all starts very innocently, subconsciously.
But through all of that exposure, you have automatically developed a certain taste.
Even if you tried, you couldn't avoid it.

I think what differentiates an expert from a random person is that the expert can precisely articulate *why* certain things matter to them.
What effect certain changes have on the experience.
Simply put: experts **care**.

We care even more when we practice the craft ourselves.

Show me a guitar and I can tell you if it's good or not.
It's not a party trick; every decent musician knows their instrument. 
The neck, the frets, the wood, the pickups, the finish.
It all matters.

Willie Nelson plays a 1969 Martin N-20 that he lovingly calls "Trigger."
Trigger is a worn-down piece of wood with a hole in it.
And after 10,000 performances, it developed a unique sound.
It's a great guitar played by an expert craftsman.
Willie Nelson cares about it.
The same guy has been doing repairs on the guitar since 1977.
Once you reach this level of expertise, your taste is so refined that you simply can't go back.
Willie wants full control over every aspect of the sound.
When you care about the details you need control.
And caring about details is a sign of good taste.
So good taste is to have control over the details.

Crucially, the brand barely matters. 
That's another thing that distinguishes experts from the wannabes.
Experts don't care about brands.
In fact, they might be *averse* to brands.
Brands kill products with time.

It goes a bit like this:

1. Someone creates a really good product. 
2. A small group of early adopters notices and starts to buy it. 
3. They keep telling their friends about it because they love it so much.
4. More people start to buy the product.
5. The company struggles to keep up with demand and starts to cut corners.
6. The product gets worse over time.
7. Experts move on, the product is dead.

It's almost inevitable.

When Fender was bought by CBS, they started to cut corners.
Laymen didn't notice, so Fender kept selling guitars; but experts did.

## Tragedy of the Commons

Here's the problem: almost by definition, experts will always be the minority.
And as such, most products are targeted to non-experts.
As a corollary, most products suck. 

To the people who care, this causes a lot of pain and suffering.
Because in order to convey *why* it matters and what *is* good craftsmanship,
you'd have to care enough to develop a good taste yourself, to become more proficient. 
And there's just not enough time and energy to become an expert in everything.

So we mostly get by and trust mainstream advice. 
And then we wonder why things feel "off" sometimes: why the quality feels sub-par,
but we struggle to put our finger on it.
There's a kind of tragedy in the situation.
But we are mostly oblivious to it, so we don't realize. 

## Ignorance is bliss

Note that I never answered the question: "What is good taste?"
That's because I don't believe there is an answer. 
It's all just one big circlejerk.
All those so-called "experts" don't exist (or there are too many layers of expertise to unpack)
and developing good taste is just an infinite rabbit hole.

It's a fool's errand.

Wine experts can't tell the difference between cheap and expensive wines anymore,
art critics can't tell good from bad art, it's all just one big echo chamber.

But I don't believe you should stop caring. NO!
There's joy in exploring and learning to differentiate between good and bad stuff.
It has very practical implications of buying more long-lasting tools or investing in good music equipment.
It's also great to socialize over seemingly irrelevant details and nerd out on the minutiae of a craft.
It's a great bonding experience to talk about motorcycle exhaust systems or the best way to brew coffee.

I believe everyone should have at least one thing they obsess about.
A thing they are an "expert" in, no matter how small.
It makes for a richer life.
And to truly become an expert, you have to learn from the masters and learn a craft for real.
Only then can you start to dismiss their advice and build your own thing.
Picasso learned how to draw like an old master by 14, only to reinvent art as he got older. 

> "It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child."
> — [Pablo Picasso](https://www.pablopicasso.org/quotes.jsp)

It takes one to know one.

## So... Which Font Should I Pick?

You've realized by now that this was not an article about typography.
I think it doesn't matter which font you pick.
What matters is that you realize that you're either consciously ignorant about fonts,
or that you are willing to spend time and energy to learn more about fonts.
At the end of the day, it's all just very subjective and contextual.
Experiment and learn from other people.
Develop your own taste.

If you stare at text for a long time every day, 
I think learning more about fonts is a quality of life improvement. 

And if you create "products" for other people to use, it becomes all the more important 
to make a tasteful, conscious decision. 
It's just as personal as your signature or your choice of words: it shows who you are
and what is important to you.

I've been honing this blog design for two decades now.
For every version, I try to explain a little better what matters to me.
I've developed a very specific taste for what I think is a good blog.
Is it any good? I don't know and honestly, I doubt it.
But at least I can explain to you *why* I made every single decision
and I hope you can tell.

Good taste brings joy to other people -- if only subconsciously.
