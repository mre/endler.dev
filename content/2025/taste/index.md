I hate bad typography.

I spent *years* telling myself fonts don't matter. "It's just letters on paper," I'd say.
But one day, staring at a poorly designed poster, something in me snapped.

Most people claim to appreciate good design – right until they reach for Comic Sans to make their wedding invitations "fun." They see a beautifully designed magazine spread and say it looks "nice."

Then there's people like me who can't stop caring. We *obsess*.

Here's the truth: you can't **NOT** pick a font.
Your choice reveals your taste like clothing reveals your style. 
And your choice communicates a lot about you.
Once you start seeing nuance, you can't unsee. 

## Personal Taste 

*Everything* in this world is somebody's obsession. Sneakers. Mechanical keyboards. Vintage bottle caps. 

When you spend enough time with anything, the patterns start to emerge.

Watch 10,000 movies and suddenly you're analyzing dutch angles and obsessing over color grading. You notice pacing issues that others don't.

Congratulations! Movies are forever ruined for you.

You've developed taste. Specific, personal taste.

To outsiders, it's incomprehensible why you spend an ungodly amount of time researching camera models or why you know the name of [that random student in the 'Social Network' movie](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

## Good Taste

Just because you have taste doesn't mean you have good taste.
Good taste is different. It's the ability to notice quality in something even if it does not match your personal taste. 
It's when you notice how someone else expresses their refined, carefully groomed, personal taste through the choices they make.
When you look at it and it "just fits."
It's an extension of their personality.

There is a correlation between having good taste and being an expert
in something.
Both groups of people can tell you *exactly why* something matters. They know precisely what effect each detail has on the experience. 

Simply put: experts **care**.

Take guitars for example.

Willie Nelson plays a 1969 Martin N-20 called "Trigger." To most, it's just a worn-down piece of wood with a hole in it. But after 10,000 performances, it's developed a sound that can't be replicated. The same repairman has been maintaining it since 1977.

At this level, you can't go back. Willie demands control over every aspect of his sound.

And that's what good taste is – caring enough to control the details that most never notice.

## Good Taste Can't Be Bought 

Just because you buy an Apple computer doesn't mean you have good taste.
Millions of people own Apple devices.
To most people, it's just a good product at best or a status symbol at worst.
That purchase doesn't make you an artist or an original thinker 
similar to how buying Air Jordan's doesn't make you Michael Jordan.

In fact, experts would like you to not buy Apple products.
That's because strong brands kill great products with time.

The cycle goes like this: 

1. Someone creates something brilliant. 
2. Early adopters discover it and evangelize.
3. Popularity grows.
4. The company cuts corners to meet demand.
5. Quality suffers.
6. Experts abandon ship.
7. The product dies. 

## TODO: Please add a better, simple headline here 

Here's the problem: almost by definition, experts will always be in the minority.
<needs logical connecting sentence(s)>

As a result, most products target non-experts. So most products suck.

For those who care, this causes genuine suffering.
To explain *why* something matters, the other person would need to develop taste themselves. And nobody has time to become an expert in everything.

So we trust mainstream advice and wonder why things feel "off" sometimes.
We sense the sub-par quality but can't articulate why.
Like a car that works, but feels "gimmicky", "clunky", or "cheap."
It's a silent tragedy we remain largely oblivious to.

## Does Good Taste Exist?

I don't think there's an answer.
It might all be one big circlejerk.
Maybe "experts" don't really exist – or there are too many layers of expertise to untangle.
Maybe developing taste is just an infinite rabbit hole in and of itself.

Nothing makes sense anymore.
Wine experts fail blind tastings.
Art critics contradict each other constantly.
We reached a point of hyper-customization where everything can be tailored to our own taste.
Algorithms decide what we like.
Everything got fragmented into tiny niche communities.
It's all just one big echo chamber.

And yet: don't stop caring. NO!

There's profound joy in learning to distinguish the good from the bad.
It leads to owning better tools.
Making smarter purchases.
You learn to discover different layers of personality.
It creates community when you nerd out over coffee grinders.
The irrelevant details matter.
All of the quirkiness is what brings color and meaning to the human existence.

I believe everyone should have at least one thing they obsess about.
A thing they call themselves an "expert" in, no matter how niche.
It makes for a richer life.
And to truly become an expert?
You have to learn from the masters.
Only after you can dismiss their advice and develop your own taste. 
Picasso learned how to draw like an old master by 14, only to reinvent art as he got older.

It takes one to know one.

## Just Tell Me Which Font To Pick

This is not an article about typography.
I think it doesn't matter which font you pick.
What matters is that you realize that you're either consciously ignorant about typography,
or that you need to spend time and energy to learn more about it to make better decisions. 
At the end of the day, it's all just very subjective and contextual.
Experiment and learn from other people.
Develop your own taste.
And if that takes too much time, just steal from someone else.
[That's what Picasso did, at least.](https://creativityclasses.com/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/)

If you stare at text for a long time each day, 
I think learning more about fonts is a quality of life improvement. 

And if you create "products" for other people to use, it becomes all the more important 
to make a tasteful, conscious decision. 
It's just as personal as your signature or your choice of words: it shows who you are
and what is important to you.

Try to develop good taste in the things that matter to you.
For example, I've been honing this blog design for two decades now
and I'm far from done.
However, for every version, I try to express a little clearer what I want to say. 
The messaging becomes simpler.
I don't know if my personal taste turned into good taste,
but at least I can explain to you *why* every single decision
mattered to me.
And I think that's a good start.
