I spent *years* telling myself typography doesn't matter.
"It's just letters on paper," I'd say.
But the truth is, I hate bad typography.

Most people claim to appreciate good design – right until they reach for Comic Sans to make their wedding invitations "fun."
They see a beautifully designed magazine spread and say it looks "nice."

Then there's people like me who can't stop caring.

Here's the truth: you can't **NOT** care about typography. 
Eventually you got to pick a font (or choose the default).
Your choice, just like clothing, reveals a lot about you. 
Whether you intend to or not, you're making a statement.

## Personal Taste 

*Everything* in this world is somebody's obsession.
Sneakers.
Mechanical keyboards.
Vintage bottle caps.

When you spend enough time with anything, patterns emerge.

Watch 10,000 movies and suddenly you're analyzing dutch angles and obsessing over color grading.
You notice pacing issues that others don't.
Congratulations!
Movies are forever ruined for you.

Once you start seeing nuance, you can't unsee it.
You've developed taste.
Very specific, personal taste.

To outsiders, it's incomprehensible why you'd spend an ungodly amount of time researching camera models or why you know the name of [that random student in the 'Social Network'](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

Picking up on the finer details is the first step towards developing something more substantive than mere preference; it's the foundation of good taste.

## Good Taste

Just because you have personal preferences doesn't mean you have good taste.
Good taste is recognizing quality in things even when it doesn't match your personal preferences.
It's appreciating how *someone else* expresses their personal taste through deliberate choices
and recognizing how it matches the subculture they feel part of.
You look at something and it just... fits.
It feels natural; effortless.

What connects good taste and expertise is attention to detail.
Both come from deeply caring about something.
Both require understanding why each element matters.
Both demand knowing precisely what effect every decision has.

Simply put: people with good taste **care**.
And they care enough to become experts in their field.
Or perhaps it's the experts who care enough to develop good taste?

Take Willie Nelson's guitar, "Trigger," a 1969 Martin N-20.
To most, it's just a worn-down chunk of wood with a hole in it.
But after 10,000 performances, it's developed a sound that can't be replicated.
The same repairman has been maintaining it since 1977.
At this stage, there's no way back. 
Willie **demands** control over every aspect of his sound.
Because the details are what makes the whole.

Is it Willie Nelson who shaped "Trigger" into a unique guitar?
Or is it the guitar that informed Willie's sound? 
Would both be equally great without the other?

Good taste is caring enough to demand control over the details that **don't** matter
&ndash; because that's all that matters.

To truly develop good taste, you must first learn from masters.
Only then can you dismiss their advice and find your own voice.
Picasso learned to draw like an old master by 14, only to reinvent art as he got older.

It takes one to know one.
And there is no shortcut...

## You Can't Buy Good Taste

Buying an Apple device doesn't prove you have good taste. 
Millions own Apple devices.
To most, it's just a status symbol.
That purchase doesn't make you an artist any more than buying Air Jordans makes you a pro basketball player. 

In fact, people with good taste develop an aversion to brands. 
That's because strong brands tend to kill great products with time.

The cycle goes like this: 

1. Someone creates something brilliant.
2. Early adopters discover it and can't stop talking about it. 
3. Popularity grows.
4. The company cuts corners to meet demand.
5. Quality suffers.
6. Early adopters abandon the product. 

Most products target the average consumer.
So most products settle for mediocrity.
Since we can't be experts in everything, we trust the advice from other people only to wonder why things feel "off" sometimes.
We *sense* sub-par quality but can't articulate why, which is a bit tragic if you ask me.

Or maybe it's fine and I'm just overthinking it?
What if there is no such thing as good taste?

## Does Good Taste Exist?

I don't think there's a definitive answer!
It might all be one big circlejerk.

Nothing makes sense anymore.
Wine experts fail blind tastings.
Art critics contradict each other constantly.
We've reached a point of hyper-customization where everything can be tailored to our highly specific preferences.
We don't get in touch with the rough and the uncomfortable.
But without exposure to things we don't like we can't develop our own taste.
Most people didn't like their first beer or coffee; it's an acquired taste.

Maybe good taste is just an illusion.
Maybe we just stroke our egos by pretending to have good taste.
Maybe striving to develop good taste is itself a fool's errand. 

Nowadays, algorithms decide what we like.
We're so deeply entrenched in our own bubbles that we can't develop our own distinct taste for what we like.
Instead, we're getting the average of what other people similar to us like and this lack of novelty feels bland and boring.
It's all just one giant echo chamber.

## What Now? 

On one side, I think taste matters deeply but on the other side I say it's all subjective and possibly irrelevant.
How does that fit together? 

Both can be true at the same time.
I think good taste is a personal journey and you should not stop caring.

There's profound joy in learning to distinguish the good from the bad.
It leads to owning better tools, making smarter purchases.
You discover different facets of personality in other people.
We create strong bonds when we nerd out over coffee grinders.
All those seemingly irrelevant details matter!
All of that quirkiness brings color. 
It's part of the human experience.

So get yourself out there and try something different for a change.

At the end of the day, it's all subjective and contextual anyway, but I believe everyone should have at least one thing they obsess about for no rational reason.
A domain they truly call themselves an expert in, no matter how small.
It makes for a richer life.

When you create products for others, tasteful decisions become all the more important.
It's as personal as it gets, just like your signature or choice of words.
It shows who you are and where you belong. 

Try to develop good taste in the things that matter to you.

Experiment and learn from others to develop your own taste.
Or just steal from someone else and adapt over time.
[That's what Picasso did, at least.](https://creativityclasses.com/good-artists-copy-great-artists-steal/)

I've been honing this blog design for two decades and I'm far from done.
With each version, though, I try to express my ideas more clearly.
And it turns out my design language becomes *simpler*.

Part of it is great typography and spacing. Add some color to it and you've come a long way.

I don't know if my personal taste has evolved into good taste, but I can explain *why* I made every decision the way I did. 
And I think that's a damn good start.
