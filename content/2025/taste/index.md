The year is 2015 and I realize that something is very wrong with me.
Maybe I stared at a poster or perhaps I saw a shop sign, but for the first time in my life,
I realize that I hate bad typography.

Now, a lot of people subconciously like good typography; or at least that's what they think
until you see them reach for Comic Sans whenever they need a "cute" font for their printout,
but that's not what I want to convey; it's become a trope by now.

No, I mean that if you see a great logo or a nicely designed magazine article, you can't help but
think "oh gosh, that's neat!" without really knowing *why* it works. It's just... "well done."

Then on the other end of the spectrum you have people like me, who *obsesses* over typography,
even though I actively **refused** to care about it.
I told myself that it doesn't matter which font to pick as it's just letters on a piece of paper.
But also: you can't not **NOT** pick a font -- and your choice *will* say something about yourself;
about taste.
It's like fashion: like it or not, but you're communicating through your clothing style.
Good taste shows.
People who care will take notice.
The question is just whether you remain oblivious to it.
I myself couldn't bring myself to pick a random font, so I had to study fonts whether I wanted to or not. 

Anyways.

What I really asked myself is... 

## What IS Good Taste?

*Everything* is someone's hobby.

Every single thing on this world is a thing some people obsess about. 
Whether it be sneakers, mechanical keyboards, crown caps, or toy cars.

It all starts very innocently, subconsciously.
But over time you start to notice patterns.

Take movies for example.
Once you saw 10.000 movies, you start to recognize dutch angles, the color grading, the pacing, the lighting, everything. 
Congratulations, movies have been forever ruined for you.

What happened is that you started to develop a very specific taste for what makes a great movie.
It's like a nod from the director to you, the viewer.
To an outsider, it's extremely hard to comprehend why you spend an ongodly amount of time
researching the camera model used in a specific movie or why you know the name of the actor
who played [that student in the Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035503/).

But! Through all of that research and experience, you have developed a certain taste.

I think what differentiates an expert from a random guy is that the expert 
can precisely articulate *why* certain things matter.
What effect things have on the consumer.
Experts care.
They care if the creators care.

All those minor details are signs of great craftsmanship
and we develop a sense for craftsmanship when we spend time with something.
It gets worse when we practice a craft ourselves.

Show me a guitar and I can tell you if it's a good one or not.
It's not magic, every decent guitarist can do that. 
The neck, the frets, the wood, the pickups, the electronics, the finish.
It all matters.

Crucially, the brand matters the least.
That's another thing that distinguishes experts from the wannabes.
Experts don't care about brands.
In fact, they might be *averse* to brands.
Brands kill products with time.

It goes a bit like this:

1. Someone creates a really good product. 
2. A small group of early adopters notices and starts to buy it. 
3. They keep telling their friends about it because they love it so much.
4. More people start to buy the product.
5. The company struggles to keep up with demand and starts to cut corners.
6. The product gets worse over time.
7. Experts move on, the product is dead.

It's almost invetiable.

When Fender was bought by CBS, they started to cut corners.
Laymen didn't notice, so Fender kept selling guitars; but experts did.

## Tragedy of the Commons

Here's the problem: almost by definition, experts will always be the minority.
And as such, most of the products are targeted to non-experts.
As a corollary, most products suck. 

To the people who care, this causes a lot of pain and suffering.
Because in order to convey *why* it matters and what *is* good craftsmanship,
you'd have to care enough to develop a good taste yourself, to become more proficient. 
And there's just not enough time and energy to become an expert in everything.

So we mostly <coast by> and trust mainstream advice. 
And then we wonder why things feel "off" sometimes: why the quality feels sub-par,
but we struggle to point our finger at it.
There's a kind of tragedy in the situation.
But we are mostly <obliviant> to the situation, so we don't realize. 

## Ignorance is bliss

Note that I never answerd the question: "What is good taste?"
That's because I don't believe there is an anwer. 
It's all just one big circlejerk.
All those so-called "experts" don't exist (or there are too many layers of expertism to unpack)
and developing good taste is just an infinite rabbit hole.

It's a fool's errand.

Wine experts can't tell the difference between cheap and expensive vines anymore,
art critiques can't tell good from bad art, it's all just one big echo chamber.

But I don't believe you should stop caring. NO!
There's joy in exploring and learning to differentiate between good and bad stuff.
It has very practical implications of buying more long-lasting tools or investing in good music equipment.
It's also great to socialize over seemingly irrelevant details and nerd out on the minutiae of a craft.
It's a great bonding experience to talk about motorcycles exhaust systems or the best way to brew coffee.

I believe, everyone should have at least one thing they obsess about.
A thing they are an "expert" in, no matter how small.
It makes for a richer life.
And to truly become an expert, you have to learn from the masters and learn a craft for real.
Only then can you start to dismiss their advice and build your own thing.
Picasso learned how to draw like an old master by 14, only to reinvent art as he got older. 

> It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child. ”
> — [Pablo Picasso](https://www.pablopicasso.org/quotes.jsp)

It takes one to know one.

## So... which font should I pick?

You realized by now that this was not an article about typography.
I think it doesn't matter which font you pick.
What matters is that you realize that you're either conciously ignorant about fonts,
or that you are willing to spend time and energy to learn more about fonts.
At the end of the day, it's all just very subjective and contextual.
Experiment and learn from other people.
Develop your own taste.

If you stare at text for a long time every day, 
I think learning more about fonts is a quality of life improvement. 
And if you create "products" for other people to use, it becomes all the more important 
to make a tasteful, conscious decision. 
It's just as personal as your signature or your choice of words: it shows who you are
and what is important to you.

Good taste brings joy to other people -- if only subconciously.
