I’ve been refining this blog’s design for two decades, and I’m still at the beginning. 
But with each new version, I get a little better at expressing what matters to me and I allow myself to let my more of my personality shine through. 

Turns out, the design keeps getting *simpler* with time. 
Now it's mostly typography and negative space. 
I got better at knowing what I can take away. 

I don’t know what it says about my personal taste.
But I can explain to you *why* I made every decision.
And that’s a damn good place to start.



## Obsession, Preference, and Taste 

Spend enough time with anything, and you’ll develop strong opinions about it. 
You become obsessed with the details.
And *everything* is somebody's obsession.  

Sneakers. Mechanical keyboards. Barbie dolls. 

Watch enough movies and you might start analyzing Dutch angles and obsessing over color grading. 
You start notice subtle issues in pacing. 
You'll [recognize the same actor in different roles](https://nexte.st/docs/design/how-it-works/), even if they’re just a random extra.

Once you start seeing nuance, you can never unsee it. 
You’ve developed a strong personal preference. 

But at this stage, you're just a guy with an opinion.

But also: picking up on the finer details is the first step toward something more than just preference — it’s a requirement for developing *good* taste.

## Good Taste

I spent *years* telling myself typography doesn't matter.
"It's just letters on paper," I'd say. Irrelevant!

But the truth is, I love typography as much as I love writing.

No matter how hard you try, you can’t *NOT* care about typography.  
Eventually, you *have* to pick a font (or use the default). 
Your choice — [like clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us52N76XA28) — tells something about you.  
Whether you mean to or not, you’re making a statement if you reach for Comic Sans for that wedding announcement. 
It's a matter of taste.

But what exactly does it mean when people say "you have bad/good taste"?
Is having good taste a skill you can learn?
When does taste turn into an obsession? 
How deep does the rabbit-hole go?

Good taste begins with noticing the finer details others miss.
If you want to develop good taste, learn to see the details in the things you care about. 

Having preferences isn’t the same as having good taste.  

Preferences are just opinions, but good taste is about *recognizing quality outside your own preferences*.  

It’s recognizing how something expresses an idea, a philosophy, through deliberate choices.
It's deeply rooted in context and subculture, that requires an understanding of the history and craftsmanship behind it.

## Expertise

There is some connection between good taste and expertise.
What links good taste and expertise is attention to detail. 

Both come from caring deeply. 
Both require knowing *why* things work. 
Both demand awareness of the effect each decision has.

People with good taste care more about details than the average person.
And often they care enough to become experts.
One informs the other: experts care enough to develop good taste and good taste shows expertise. 

Take Willie Nelson’s guitar, "Trigger" — a 1969 Martin N-20.  
Taken out of context, it’s just a worn-down chunk of wood.  
It might equally be the guitar of a busker.
But after 10,000 performances, it has a sound that can’t be replicated.  
The same repairman’s maintained it since 1977.
That’s dedication to craftsmanship if I’ve ever seen it.

Willie could have easily bought a new guitar, but he didn’t.
He developed such a strong taste for the sound he wanted that he refused to settle for anything less than the perfect instrument, Trigger. 

Willie *demands* control over every part of his sound.  
Willie *obsesses* over details.
Because the details are what control the sound. 

He didn't do anything out of the ordinary, but he did the ordinary so well that it became extraordinary.

Experts demand full control because control is what allows them to express their ideas *just* the way they want.
Control becomes a key element. 

But here's what's interesting:
Is it Willie who shaped the guitar, or the guitar that rounded Willie’s sound? 
Would they be equally great without each other? 
They aged together. They'll die together.

Good taste is caring enough to control the details that **don’t** matter — because that’s all that matters.
That's where the magic is.

Good taste means knowing what you can remove.
Without Willie, Trigger would just be a chunk of wood.
But without Trigger, Willie would sound different.
But Willie knows sound is not about the looks.
Good taste means developing intuition on what to focus on.
Good taste means *knowing what really matters*.

If you watch an artist perform, it often looks effortless.
That's because they know what matters and what doesn't.
They focus on the details that make a difference, and they ignore the rest, which makes the task simpler for them.
It reduces cognitive overhead.

## You Can’t Just Buy Good Taste

Buying an Apple device doesn’t mean you have good taste.  
Millions own them.
For many, it’s just a status symbol.  
Apple helps you think different in the same way that Air Jordans help you jump higher. 

In fact, people with good taste often *avoid* brands.
Brands are what kill great products. 

The cycle goes like this:

1. Someone creates something great.  
2. Early adopters rave about it.  
3. Popularity grows.  
4. The product gets adjusted for the mass market. 
5. Quality drops.  
6. Early adopters move on.

Most products are built for the average customer.
So most products settle for average quality. 
We can’t be experts in everything, so we trust what others say — then wonder why most products suck. 

We *sense* when something’s sub-par, even if we can’t put our finger on it. 
That’s a little tragic.

Or maybe I’m just overthinking it.
It might all just be subjective in the end.
Maybe good taste is an illusion. 

## Does Good Taste Exist?

I don’t think there’s a definitive answer. 
But it’s hard to a develop unique taste today because we’re surrounded by custom-tailored feeds and algorithms that show us only what we like.
But without exposure to things we *don’t* like, we can’t discover things we *do*.

If we get too comfortable, we stop to develop better taste. 
Our preferences become narrow, superficial, shallow.

## What Now?

On one side, I think taste matters deeply. 
On the other, it’s all subjective and possibly irrelevant.

Both can be true!
It depends on the context.

There’s joy in learning to tell the good from the bad. 
It leads to better tools and smarter choices. 
If you stop to care, you will be surrounded by mediocre things.
Good taste is a personal journey. 

We bond over espresso grinders and film stocks. 
Those weird little details matter? 
They make life more colorful.
It's part of the human experience.

Everyone should have at least one thing they irrationally obsess over. 
Something they know inside and out. 
It makes life richer.

When you create for others, your taste becomes visible — it's like a signature or a voice. 
It shows who you are and what you care about.

So experiment, learn from others, or just steal and refine as you go.
