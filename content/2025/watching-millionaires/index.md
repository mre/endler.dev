I watched the Champions League final the other day when it struck me:

**I'm basically watching millionaires all the time.**

The players are millionaires, the coaches are millionaires, the club owners are millionaires. It's surreal.

This week I watched John Wick Ballerina and, again, there's Keanu Reeves, who is a millionaire, and Ana de Armas, who is as well.

Yesterday I heard of Trump and Musk fighting. They are not millionaires, they are billionaires! 

As I'm writing this, I'm watching the Rock am Ring live stream, a music festival in Germany.
Weezer is playing.
These guys are all millionaires.

I don't know what to make of it. Just found it an interesting observation that I wanted to share.

Now I could do this whole thing about watching millionaires while we neglect our friends and family, or the people we live next to, but I think that would be next to the point.

There's also a case to be made that the power law applies here: a few people make it big, and we all made them big by watching them. 
The majority of people in the entertainment industry, however, are not millionaires.
They are struggling artists, actors, musicians, and so on.
We stick to an elite few, and that skews our perception.

Make of it what you will.
But I think it's worth reflecting on how we consume media and what it says about our values and priorities:

- Do we value the stories and experiences of everyday people?
- Do we celebrate the achievements of those who are not in the spotlight?
- Do we recognize the hard work and dedication of those who may never become millionaires?
- Are we aware of the impact our consumption choices have on the industry and society as a whole?

You're on a tiny blog by a tiny man and if you made it this far, I appreciate you.
It looks as if you care about the little stories as well.
If you're anything like me, you're actively *seeking* them out -- but there's so little of it nowadays.
Well, there are [still places](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) where people share their stories, but you need to know where to look.

If anything, we all should share more.
Write about the little things, the everyday moments, the people you meet, the things *you* care about.
Don't live anybody else's life!

Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer of Weezer, once wrote:

> My motivation is much different now than it was then: then I was terribly discontent and dreaming of being a classical composer, a writer, or basically **anything that I wasn’t**; now I just want to enjoy my life and do the responsible thing—graduate. 

That's from his [Letter For Readmission To Harvard--2005](https://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/Harvard).

I think that's a great mindset. 
Nobody forced him to go back to Harvard after so many years.
He was a freaking millionaire rock star by then.

And yet, he did.

The way I read it, he stopped *pretending* and started *living*.

So, stop pretending. Be who you are.
