As a kids, our parents established a few simple rules that we would all follow, no matter the circumstances.
One of them was that we'd always have dinner together at 6pm.
Not 5:30pm, not 7pm, 6pm.

At lot of things have to go right to always have dinner at 6.

- You have to be home by 6.
- Obviously, you have to put food on the table.
- But you have take the time to sit down. 

In almost two decades they never broke the rule.
We had dinner on 9/11. 
We had dinner when mom was at the hospital.
It's not easy.

There's a a nice thing which happen when you have such a golden rule: it has ripple effects.
Since we had dinner at 6, we would always have time to talk about the day.
Problems would be uncovered earlier.
We would know about each others appointments for the next day.
It provided structure throughout the rest of the day.
It put things into perspective. 
It grounded us.

- Bad grade at school? Dinner at 6.
- Played computer games all afternoon and lost track of time? Dinner at 6.

Still, it sounded like one of those "stupid" rules only grownups would come up with.
And in fact, my parents knew that it was stupid.
They just did it anyway.
As a kid, that made their life look extremely dull and boring.
I remember that I pitied my dad once for being such a slave to society.
They just did it anyway.
Not because they stuck to the rule, but because they knew about the positive consequences.
There were a million other such rules in our lifes and they all made no sense -- except they did!

My parents didn't invent that rule for fun. They did so because they had to.
Without it, things would fall apart.
Skipping dinner once is about way more than skipping dinner.
It's a problem in disguise.
At least I would know that something was up.

## These rules are simple, but not easy. 

(I recommend Rich Hickey's talk to clarify the nuance in those words)

It's a very simple rule in that it doesn't have a lot of room for interpretation.
Setting an alarm is simple, too.
The act itself is simple.

However it's not easy as in "convenient": there are times when you have to drop something else to have dinner at 6.
There are times when these rules are reeeeally inconvencient and get in the way.
When you're in the middle of "something."
That's when the rule counts the most.
That's what makes or breaks it.
Turns out you're always in the middle of something.
[Don't break the chain.](https://sureshjoshi.com/productivity/dont-break-the-chain-says-seinfeld)
Following the rule 90% of the time is much easier than following it 100% of the time.
You have to make sacrifices.
You have to say no sometimes.
You might have to disappoint people.
That's the price it takes.

My parents knew that or they intuitively inhabitated that from their parents.
It makes sense if you think about it for a while.
What's funny is that my parents discovered that in their twenties.
More than a decade earlier than me.
Maybe you learn to cope with crazy challenges like raising kids by making up irrational rules.

Yes, the rules "sound" stupid, but there's a deeper, almost stoic realization to it:
life is complicated and it will throw you obstacles in your way and that's unfair. 
But if you really want to make progress in life, you have to do irrational things at times. 
If nothing else helps, make up a stupid rule.
Like dinner at 6.

I'm only now discovering that for myself.
In 2019, I mentioned to my friend Abu that I feel bad for not doing any sports.
He suggested to go for a run together on Tuesdays - no matter what.
I found that ridiculous and told him that it couldn't possibly work.
I started negotiating.
But there's no point in negotiating with irrationality.
Fast forward 5 years and I still run every Tuesday.
I don't run fast. I don't run far, but I run.
I made time.
I made it work.
Again, it had positive rippling effects:
I ran in different cities and countries. 
I ran in Greece and on Sardinia.
I ran with different people.
If I have to be somewhere on a Tuesday, I'll bring my running shoes.
Now, did I always manage to run on a Tuesday?
No, because it's not easy.
But I _always_ tried and I can count the times I didn't on one hand.
Since Abu and me run together a lot, another thing happened: we would talk about the week.
We would know more about each other.
Just because we make it work somehow.

Some people won't understand when you tell them that you have to do a thing "no matter what."
After all, there's an exception to every rule, no?
I don't tell them that I have to go for a run; I tell them that I'm busy that evening and ask if Wednesday works.

I find these rules extremely interesting.
Another "no matter what" rule is that I'll always take the time to play with my cat in the evening.
No matter what.
Of course, like putting food on the table, I sort of have to.
I find that it gives me structure; a frame for the rest of my day.
No matter if I talk to the CTO of a large company, play time is sacred.

No matter what, I'll save 100 bucks every month.
No matter what, I'll sit down to write every day.

Many people could do that, few do.

I found that not many people in my circle follow such rules; at least I'm not aware of them.
But the ones who do tend to be the more interesting people!
I have a friend who makes one contribution to GitHub every day.
His timeline is green for the last few years.

## Isn't this just a habit?

When I think about my habits, the first that come to mind are the bad ones:
staying up late, drinking too much sugary stuff, bad sitting posture.

I have good habits, too, like always holding the keys in my hand while closing the door,
but I find that most of them can easily be dismissed or forgotten or neglected.

With "no matter what" there can be serious consequences.
If you have to take care of a loved one, you can't skip a day or there are some serious consequences.

I don't think "no matter what" rules are habits.
At least not in the beginning.
They can turn into super strong habits, though.

I found that the best way to implement a "NMW Rule" is on the spot.
When my doctor told me I have bad dental hygiene, I decided to floss my teeth every day no matter what.
It worked.

Another good way to get started is to take on some lightweight responsibility.
For example, I recommend to get plants.


Then you have to water it no matter what.
If the plant dries out, you broke the rule; simple as that.
The great thing is that the watering interval is pretty low usually, so you have time to get used to it
(but getting used to you have to)
If it works, you will enjoy the feeling of continuity.
It's like a chain of good deeds.
A new habit is born.

In the past, I never had any plants.
Now our apartment is full of them.
I enjoy the companionship and the continuity.


## What's your "nmw"?

If you already have a "no matter what" rule, I have my deepest respect.

If not, whether you want to write that book or you want to run that marathon,
a good way to make progress towards that goal is a "nmw rule".
Start simple.
