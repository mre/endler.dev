As kids, our parents established a few simple rules that we would all follow, no matter the circumstances.
One of them was that we'd always have dinner together at 6pm.
Not 5:30pm, not 7pm, 6pm.

A lot of things have to go right to always have dinner at 6.

- You have to be home by 6.
- Obviously, you have to put food on the table.
- But you also have to take the time to sit down. 

In almost two decades, they never broke that rule.
We had dinner on 9/11 and when mom was at the hospital.
It's not always easy.

There's a nice thing that happens when you have such a golden rule: it has ripple effects.
Since we had dinner at 6, we would always have time to talk about the day.
Problems would be uncovered earlier.
We would know about each other's appointments for the next day.
It provided structure throughout the rest of the day.
It put things into perspective. 
It grounded us.

- Bad grade at school? Dinner at 6.
- Played computer games all afternoon and lost track of time? Dinner at 6.
- No matter how bad your day was, dinner is always waiting for you at 6.

Still, it sounded like one of those "stupid" rules only grown-ups would come up with.
And in fact, my parents knew that it was stupid.
They did it anyway.
As a kid, that made their life look extremely dull and boring.
I remember pitying my dad once for being such a slave to society.
Yet, they persisted.
Not because they stuck to the rule, but because they knew about the positive consequences.
There were a few other such rules in our lives, and they all made no sense -- except they did!

My parents didn't invent that rule for fun. They did so because they had to.
Without it, things would fall apart.
Skipping dinner once is about way more than skipping dinner.
It's a problem in disguise.
At the very least, I would know that something was up.

## These rules are simple, but not easy. 

(I recommend Rich Hickey's talk to clarify the nuance in those words)

It's a very simple rule in that it doesn't have a lot of room for interpretation.
Setting an alarm is simple, too.
The act itself is straightforward.

However, it's not easy as in "convenient": there are times when you have to drop something else to have dinner at 6.
There are times when these rules are really inconvenient and get in the way.
When you're in the middle of "something."
That's when the rule counts the most.
That's what makes or breaks it.
Turns out you're always in the middle of something.
[Don't break the chain.](https://sureshjoshi.com/productivity/dont-break-the-chain-says-seinfeld)
Following the rule 90% of the time is much easier than following it 100% of the time.
You have to make sacrifices.
You have to say no sometimes.
You might have to disappoint people.
That's the price it takes.

My parents knew that or they intuitively inherited it from their parents.
It makes sense if you think about it for a while.
What's funny is that my parents discovered this in their twenties.
More than a decade earlier than me.
Perhaps you learn to cope with crazy challenges (like raising kids) by making up irrational rules.

Yes, the rules "sound" stupid, but there's a deeper, almost stoic realization to it:
life is complicated and it will throw obstacles in your way, and that's unfair. 
But if you really want to make progress in life, you have to find a way. 
If nothing else helps, make up a stupid rule.
Dinner at 6.

Only now am I discovering this for myself.
In 2019, I mentioned to my friend Abu that I felt bad for not doing any sports.
It's not that I didn't try, it's just that nothing lasted for long.
He suggested going for a run together on Tuesdays - no matter what.
I thought that was ridiculous.
I told him that it couldn't possibly work.
Why Tuesdays!?
It felt so random.
In my mind, I started negotiating.
But there's no point in negotiating with irrationality.
Fast forward 5 years, and I still run every Tuesday.
My pace isn't fast. The distance isn't far, but it's a solid effort.
Time was made.
It worked out.
Again, it had positive rippling effects:
I ran on Crete in Greece and Sardinia in Italy.
Different people joined me on my runs.
If Tuesday finds me elsewhere, my running shoes come along.
Now, did I always manage to run on a Tuesday?
No. It's not easy!
But I _always_ tried and I can count the times I didn't run on one hand.
Since Abu and I run together a lot, we would talk about the week.
We would get to know each other on a different level.
All just because we make it work somehow.

Some people won't understand when you tell them that you have to do a thing "no matter what."
After all, there's an exception to every rule, right?
Instead of telling them I have to go for a run, I say I'm busy that evening and ask if another day works.
Nobody asks more questions.

I find these rules extremely interesting.
Another "no matter what" rule is that I'll always take the time to play with my cat in the evening.
No matter what.
Of course, like putting food on the table, it's somewhat of a necessity.
It provides structure; a frame for the rest of my day.
No matter if I talk to the CTO of a large company, play time is sacred.

"No matter what, I'll save 100 bucks every month."  
"No matter what, I'll sit down to write every day."  

Many people could do that, few do.

I found that not many people in my circle follow such rules; at least I'm not aware of them.
But the ones who do tend to be the more interesting people!
A friend of mine makes at least one contribution on GitHub every day.
His timeline is all green for the last few years.

## Isn't this just a habit?

When I think about my habits, the first that come to mind are the bad ones:
staying up late, drinking too much sugary stuff, bad sitting posture.

I have good habits, too, like always holding the keys in my hand while closing the door,
but I find that most of them can easily be dismissed or forgotten or neglected.

With "no matter what" there can be serious consequences.
If you have to take care of a loved one, you can't skip a day or there are some serious consequences.
Or if you're an Air Traffic Controller, failure is not an option.
You have to get that plane on the ground safely -- no matter what.

My stakes are not as high, but I take them very seriously.

"No matter what" rules aren't habits, at least not in the beginning.
They can, however, turn into super strong habits with time.

I found that the best way to implement a "NMW Rule" is on the spot.
When my doctor asked me if I floss every day (I didn't), I made the decision to start right then and there.
It worked.
I might have skipped five days total and I'm planning to keep it at five forever.

Another good way to get started is to take on some lightweight responsibility.
For example, I recommend getting plants.
Then you have to water them -- no matter what.

If the plant dries out, you broke the rule; simple as that.
The great thing is that the watering interval is usually pretty low, so there's time to get used to it
(but getting used to it you must).

If it works, you'll enjoy the feeling of continuity.
It's like a chain of good deeds.
A new habit is born.

In the past, I never had any plants.
Now our apartment is full of them.
I love the companionship and the continuity.

## What's your "NMW"?

If you already have a "no matter what" rule, you have my deepest respect.

If not, whether you want to write that book or you want to run that marathon,
a good way to make progress towards that goal is to commit to it -- no matter what.
