This post offers personal insights on predicting tech trends by observing hackers. It's based on subjective observations and should be read with critical thinking. If you're looking for meticulously researched, data-driven analyses, you might want to check out an actual research paper instead!

A good way to predict which technologies will be important in the future is to see what hackers are passionate about today.

## Defining "Hacker"

I'm using the term "hacker" in the spirit of the Hacker Ethic, as described by authors like Steven Levy and Pekka Himanen. In this context, a hacker is someone who:

- Follows their passion and seeks self-fulfillment through technology
- Creates something beneficial for the wider community
- Values freedom, cooperation, and voluntary work
- Challenges traditional work ethics with a focus on creativity and sharing

These folks are a small subset of the population, but they have some traits that make them excellent predictors of the future:

- They care deeply about their field, including (but not limited to) programming as just one example
- They're passionate about the things they believe in
- They'd use something even if no one else cared about it
- They work at the cutting edge, so they need the best tools to do their job
- They have strong opinions about what's good and what's bad, and can back up their views with facts
- They don't care about investors, quarterly earnings reports, or politics. They purely focus on the technology's value.

## Catalysts For Success And Red Flags

Of course, not every hyped technology makes it big. Remember NFTs or Web3?

One key difference is that hackers weren't truly passionate about these technologies in the first place &ndash; non-hackers were. 
Another red flag is when the technology's benefits are hard to explain.
If hardcore tech people can't explain the benefits to you, that's a bad sign.
Instead, there might be other motivations at play!

Usually, it's people trying to make money from technology.
They call themselves Investors, "Serial Entrepreneurs", or "Thought Leaders".
You can easily spot them on LinkedIn, because they update their public profile with a fresh set of buzzwords every 6 months.
There are a few legit ones, but most are opportunists who couldn't explain the technology if their life depended on it.
All they care about is profit.

The hackers? They don't care what you think about them.
They've got nothing to sell you.
They're too busy building cool stuff!

A question hackers care about is "who owns the platform"?
If it's companies, they always have an agenda.
Invest a ton of time and effort, and they might just lock you out and profit from your work.

Therefore, all the winning ideas I mentioned are open source.
If a technology isn't, that's a major red flag when evaluating its future potential.
It's not even optional anymore &ndash; it's pretty much mandatory.

But there's another reason why open source is a catalyst for success:
Initially, open source projects start as minimally functional versions without user-friendly documentation.
They might be tough to set up, but the core idea is there.
If people stick with it despite the lack of hand-holding, you know it's solving a real problem
and that's a sign of a winning idea.

## You Still Need Patience 

You probably know I'm all in on Rust
After all, [I make my living as a Rust consultant](https://corrode.dev).
It took Rust over a decade of development to gain any real traction in the industry.
It's been a slow but steady climb.

It can take a while for the general public to catch up with a trend before a technology is ready for prime time.
Sometimes it's a decade or more, especially for core technology like new programming languages or databases.
That's just the time it takes for technology to mature.

That's why I usually advise founders to stay a bit behind the curve when adopting new tech.
The industry needs time to catch up, and big companies need specialized tools to integrate new tech into their existing systems. 
On the other side, investing early in promising technologies is a calculated risk because the writing is on the wall.

## What Can You Learn From This?

Hackers are already living in the future.
You can use that to your advantage.
Ask 10 hackers what new things they're really excited about, and you'll get a good picture of what's going to be important in a few years.

Most business people don't talk to hackers regularly.
That's a fact you can use to your advantage. 

If you're selling to developers ([and you probably shouldn't](/2024/selling-to-developers/)),
the key is to really listen to what the hackers are saying and then follow their lead.
