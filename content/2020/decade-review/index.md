A while ago, I read an article titled ["What Happened In The
2010s"](https://avc.com/2019/12/what-happened-in-the-2010s/) by Fred Wilson. The
article deals with the progress in technology and business in the last 10 years.
This inspired me to share my impressions on a much smaller, but related topic:
_What Happened To Programming In The 2010s?_

## Where to start?

From a mile-high perspective, programming is still the same as a decade ago: you
write a program with an editor, feed it to a computer and receive some output.
But if we look closer, we find that _a lot_ has changed in the past decade. Many
things on the list sound obvious, because we take them for granted now.

Thinking back to 2009, I still wrote [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugins, ran
a few websites on shared hosting services and sometimes uploaded content via
FTP.
Code was copy-and-pasted from dubious forums, other websites, or hand-transcribed from
books. StackOverflow was still in its infancy.
Version control was done with SVN &mdash; if at all.
I joined Github on 3rd January 2010.

## An Explosion of New Programming Languages

The last decade saw a huge number of new and exciting programming languages! Go,
Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Rust, Typescript, Julia, Elixir, Elm, Crystal, Nim just to
name a few.

**ALL** of the above are developed in the open now and the source code is
available on Github. That means, everyone can contribute to their development;
Open Source is the default.

Each of those languages brought something new to the table, that made them
popular. Those features can be classified into a few categories:

- Type system: Kotlin and Swift support [nullable types], Typescript brings
  types to JavaScript, Algebraic datatypes are available in
  Kotlin, Swift, Typescript or Rust.
- Performance: Go made Goroutines and channels mainstream, Rust avoids Garbage Collector
  overhead.
- Interoperability: Dart compiles to JavaScript, Elixir interfaces with
  Erlang, Kotlin with Java, and Swift with Objective-C.

## Mobile First

By 2020, [over 50% of global web pages are served to mobile
phones](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/discover-the-pros-and-cons-of-mobile-apps-vs-mobile-websites).

## Old Dogs learn new tricks

But the older languages also did not stand still!

C++11 pushed the language into a new era. Lambdas, `auto` pointers, range-based
loops, and more were added to the language.

Most languages adopted a quicker release cycle. Here's a list for some popular
languages:

| Language                | Release cycle |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Java                    | 6 months      |
| C                       | irregular     |
| Python                  | 12 months     |
| C++                     | ~ 3 years     |
| C#                      | ~ 12 months   |
| Visual Basic .NET       | ~ 24 months   |
| JavaScript (Ecmascript) | 12 months     |
| PHP                     | 12 months     |
| Swift                   | 6 months      |
| Ruby                    | 12 months     |
| Go                      | 6 months      |

At the beginning of the last decade, the latest PHP version was 5.3. We are at
7.4 now. (We actually skipped 6.0. Let's not talk about it.) Along the way it
got 100% faster. It's a truly modern programming language now, with a thriving
ecosystem.

Heck, even Visual Basic has <<FEATURE>> now.

## Death of Null

Mainstream languages finally adopted safer alternatives to `null`: nullable
types, `Option`, and `Result` types Languages like Haskell had similar features
way before, but they only became mainstream in the 2010s.

## Revival of type systems

Type systems were eschewed in the early 2000s.

Typescript Python types PHP types

It goes in both directions, though. Java, C++, and Rust have type inference.

## Explosion of frameworks
