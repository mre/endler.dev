When it comes to runtime performance, Rust is one of the fastest guns in the
west. It is [on par with the likes of C and
C++](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/which-programs-are-fastest.html)
and sometimes even surpasses them. Compile times, however? That's a different story.

## Why Is Rust Compilation Slow?

Wait a sec, slow in comparison to what? For example, if you compare it with Go,
their compiler is doing a lot less work in general. It lacks support for
generics and macros. Also, the Go compiler was [built from
scratch](https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_compiler_technology_is_used_to_build_the_compilers)
as a monolithic tool consisting of both, the frontend and the backend (rather
than relying on, say, [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) to take over the backend part,
which is the case for Rust or Swift). This has advantages (more options for
tweaking the entire process, yay) and disadvantages (higher maintenance costs
and less supported architectures).

Comparing across toolchains makes little sense here, and compile times are
mostly fine for smaller projects, so if your project builds fast enough, your
job here is done.

## Choosing Runtime Over Compile-Time Performance

> As is often cautioned in debates among their designers, programming language
> design is full of tradeoffs. One of those fundamental tradeoffs is runtime
> performance vs. compile-time performance, and the Rust team nearly always (if
> not always) chose runtime over compile-time.  
> &mdash; [Brian Anderson](https://pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity/)

Overall, there are a few features and design decisions that limit Rust
compilation speed:

- **Macros**: Code generation with macros can be quite expensive.
- **Type checking**
- **Monomorphization**: this is the process of generating specialized versions
  of generic functions. E.g., a function that takes an `Into<String>` gets
  converted into one that takes a `String` and one that takes a `&str`.
- **LLVM**: that's the default compiler backend for Rust, where a lot of the
  heavy-lifting (like code-optimizations) takes place. LLVM is [notorious for
  being slow](https://nikic.github.io/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html).
- **Linking**: Strictly speaking, this is not part of compiling but happens
  right after. It "connects" your Rust binary with the system libraries. `cargo`
  does not explicitly mark the linking step, so many people add it to the
  overall compilation time.

If you're interested in all the gory details, check out [this blog
post](https://pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity/) by Brian
Anderson.

## Upstream Work

Making the Rust compiler faster is an ongoing process, and many fearless people
are [working on
it](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/04/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2020/).
Thanks to their hard work, compiler speed has improved [30-40% across the board
year-to-date, with some projects seeing up to 45%+ improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/cezxjn/compiler_speed_has_improved_3040_across_the_board/).
On top of that, Rust tracks compile regressions on a [website dedicated to
performance](https://perf.rust-lang.org/)

Work is also put into [optimizing the LLVM
backend](https://nikic.github.io/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html). Rumor
has it that there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit. üçá

## Why Bother?

Overall, the Rust compiler is legitimately doing a great job. That said, above a
certain project size, the compile times are... let's just say they could be
better.

According to the [Rust 2019
survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html), improving
compile times is #4 on the Rust wishlist:

{{ figure(src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/2020-03-RustSurvey/45-improve-adoption.svg",
caption="Rust Survey results 2019. (<a href='https://xkcd.com/303/'>Obligatory xkcd</a>.)") }}

But all hope is not lost! Below is a list of **tips and tricks on how to make
your Rust project compile faster today**. They are roughly ordered by
practicality, so start at the top and work your way down until you're happy.

## Use `cargo check` Instead Of `cargo build`

Most of the time, you don't even have to compile your project at all; you just
want to know if you messed up somewhere. Whenever you can, skip compilation
altogether. What you want instead is laser-fast code linting, type- and
borrow-checking.

For that, cargo has a special treat for you: ‚ú® `cargo check` ‚ú®. Consider the
differences in the number of instructions between `cargo check` on the left and
`cargo debug` in the middle. (Note that the scales are different.)

![Speedup factors: check 1, debug 5, opt
20](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_A57800B62E88AEE36F7155FD549213822584025ACDBC9DAC077AE34BEF6CE532_1590587846423_image.png)

A sweet trick I use is to run it in the background with [`cargo watch`](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch). This way, it will `cargo check`
whenever you change a file.

‚≠ê **Pro-tip**: Use `cargo watch -c` to clear the screen before every run.

## Use Rust Analyzer Instead Of Rust Language Server

Another quick way to check if you set the codebase on fire is to use a "language
server". That's basically a "linter as a service", that runs next to your
editor.

For a long time, the default choice here was
[rls](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls), but lately, folks moved over to
[rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer), because it's
more feature-complete and way more snappy. It supports all major IDEs.
Switching to that alone might save your day.

## Remove Unused Dependencies

So let's say you tried all of the above and find that compilation is still slow.
What now?

Dependencies sometimes become obsolete thanks to refactoring. From time to time
it helps to check if all of them are still needed to save compile time.

If this is your own project (or a project you like to contribute to), do a quick
check if you can toss anything with
[cargo-udeps](https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps):

```
cargo install cargo-udeps && cargo +nightly udeps
```

## Update Remaining Dependencies

Next, update your dependencies, because they themselves could have tidied up
their dependency tree lately.

Take a deep dive with
[`cargo-outdated`](https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-outdated) or `cargo tree`
(built right into cargo itself) to find any outdated dependencies. On top of
that, use [`cargo audit`](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit) to get
notified about any vulnerabilities which need to be addressed, or deprecated
crates which need a replacement.

Here's a nice workflow that I learned from [/u/oherrala on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/gi7v2v/is_it_wrong_of_me_to_think_that_rust_crates_have/fqe848y):

1. Run `cargo update` to update to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/)
   compatible version.
2. Run `cargo outdated -wR` to find newer, possibly incompatible dependencies.
   Update those and fix code as needed.
3. Find duplicate versions of a dependency and figure out
   where they come from: `cargo tree --duplicate` shows dependencies which come in multiple versions.  
   (Thanks to /u/dbdr for [pointing this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hdb5m4/tips_for_faster_rust_compile_times/fvm1r2w/).)

‚≠ê **Pro-tip**: Step 3 is a great way to contribute back to the community! Clone
the repository and execute steps 1 and 2. Finally, send a pull request to the
maintainers.

## Replace Heavy Dependencies

From time to time, it helps to shop around for more lightweight alternatives to
popular crates.

Again, `cargo tree` is your friend here to help you understand which of your
dependencies are quite _heavy_: they require many other crates, causing
excessive network I/O and slow down your build. Then search for lighter
alternatives.

Here are a few examples:

- Using [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)? Check out
  [miniserde](https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde) and maybe even
  [nanoserde](https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde).
- [reqwests](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) is quite heavy. Maybe try
  [attohttpc](https://github.com/sbstp/attohttpc), which is more lightweight.
- ~~[tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) dragging you down? How about [smol](https://github.com/stjepang/smol)?~~  
  (Edit: This won't help much with build times. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hdb5m4/tips_for_faster_rust_compile_times/fvmayvh/))
- Swap out [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) with [pico-args](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/pico-args) if you only need basic argument parsing.

[Here's an
example](https://blog.kodewerx.org/2020/06/the-rust-compiler-isnt-slow-we-are.html)
where switching crates reduced compile times from 2:22min to 26 seconds.

## Use Cargo Workspaces

Cargo has that neat feature called _workspaces_, which allow you to split one
big crate into multiple smaller ones. This code-splitting is great for avoiding
repetitive compilation because only crates with changes have to be recompiled.
Bigger projects like
[servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/Cargo.toml) and
[vector](https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/1629f7f82e459ae87f699e931ca2b89b9080cfde/Cargo.toml#L28-L34)
are using workspaces heavily to slim down compile times.

Learn more about workspaces
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

## Disable Unused Features Of Crate Dependencies

‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair warning**: it seems that switching off features doesn't always improve
compile time. (See [tikv's experiences
here](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/4453#issuecomment-481789292).)

Check the feature flags of your dependencies. A lot of library maintainers take
the effort to split their crate into separate features that can be toggled off
on demand. Maybe you don't need all the default functionality from every crate?

For example, `tokio` has [a ton of
features](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/2bc6bc14a82dc4c8d447521005e044028ae199fe/tokio/Cargo.toml#L26-L91)
that you can disable if needed.

A quick way to list the features of a crate is
[cargo-feature-set](https://github.com/badboy/cargo-feature-set).

Admittedly, [features are not very discoverable at the
moment](https://twitter.com/llogiq/status/1273875653822222337) because there is
no standard way to document them, but we'll get there eventually.

## Use A Ramdisk For Compilation

When starting to compile heavy projects, I noticed that I was throttled on I/O.
The reason was that I kept my projects on a measly HDD. A more performant
alternative would be SSDs, but they usually have [limited
write-cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive#Comparison_with_other_technologies).

Ramdisks to the rescue! These are like "virtual harddisks" that live in system
memory.

User [moschroe_de](https://www.reddit.com/user/moschroe_de/) shared the
following snippet [over on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/chqu4c/building_a_computer_for_fastest_possible_rust/ev02hqy),
which creates a ramdisk for your current Rust project (on Linux):

```
mkdir -p target && \
sudo mount -t tmpfs none ./target && \
cat /proc/mounts | grep "$(pwd)" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

On macOS, you could probably do something similar with [this
script](https://gist.github.com/koshigoe/822455). I haven't tried that myself,
though.

## Cache Dependencies With sccache

Another neat project is [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) by
Mozilla, which caches compiled crates to avoid repeated compilation.

I had this running on my laptop for a while, but the benefit was rather
negligible, to be honest. It works best if you work on a lot of independent
projects that share dependencies (in the same version). A common use-case is
shared build servers.

## Cranelift &ndash; The Alternative Rust Compiler

Lately, I was excited to hear that the Rust project is using an alternative
compiler that runs in parallel with `rustc` for every CI build:
[Cranelift](https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift), also called
`CG_CLIF`.

Here is a comparison between `rustc` and Cranelift for some popular crates (blue
means better):

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dGn56oGBSP2BTWq1qrP6GISfwZJOqXUC-KGKaSWQ1dw3smBoXY5klW6rXoWSJQrnOvc2bEX7E2muojG_3YRXlpwK-9lWsHuS1QL4kDyQnHF0mQhp6IYyfVaK9Kfz_zjm0lvX-UTB)

Somewhat unbelieving, I tried to compile
[vector](https://github.com/timberio/vector) with both compilers.

The results were astonishing:

- Rustc: **5m 45s**
- Cranelift: **3m 13s**

I could really feel the difference! What's cool about this is that it creates
fully working executable binaries. They won't be optimized as much, but they are
great for testing.

A more detailed write-up is on [Jason Williams'
page](https://jason-williams.co.uk/a-possible-new-backend-for-rust), and the
project code is [on Github](https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift).

## Switch To A Faster Linker

> The thing that nobody seems to target is linking time. For me, when using
> something with a big dependency tree like Amethyst, for example linking time
> on my fairly recent Ryzen 7 1700 is ~10s each time, even if I change only some

> Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/chqu4c/building_a_computer_for_fastest_possible_rust/euycz74)

According to the [official documentation](https://lld.llvm.org/), "LLD is a
linker from the LLVM project that is a drop-in replacement for system linkers
and runs much faster than them. [..] When you link a large program on a
multicore machine, you can expect that LLD runs more than twice as fast as the
GNU gold linker. Your mileage may vary, though."

If you're on Linux you can switch to `lld` [like
so](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57817848/270334):

```toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld",
]
```

A word of caution: `lld` might not be working on all platforms yet. At least on
macOS, Rust support seems to be broken at the moment, and the work on fixing it
has stalled (see
[rust-lang/rust#39915](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39915)).

## Tweak Compiler Flags

Rust comes with a huge set of [compiler
flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html). For special
cases, it can help to tweak them for your project.

## Profile Compile Times

If you like to dig deeper, Rust compilation can be profiled with [`cargo rustc -- -Zself-profile`](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html#profiling-the-compiler).
The resulting trace file can be visualized with a flamegraph or the Chromium
profiler:

![Image of Chrome profiler with all
crates](https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/inside-rust/2020-02-25-intro-rustc-self-profile/chrome_profiler3.png)

There's also a [`cargo -Z timings`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#timings)
feature that gives some information about how long each compilation step takes,
and tracks concurrency information over time.

Another golden one is
[`cargo-llvm-lines`](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines), which shows
the number of lines generated and objects copied in the LLVM backend:

```
$ cargo llvm-lines | head -20

  Lines        Copies         Function name
  -----        ------         -------------
  30737 (100%)   1107 (100%)  (TOTAL)
   1395 (4.5%)     83 (7.5%)  core::ptr::drop_in_place
    760 (2.5%)      2 (0.2%)  alloc::slice::merge_sort
    734 (2.4%)      2 (0.2%)  alloc::raw_vec::RawVec<T,A>::reserve_internal
    666 (2.2%)      1 (0.1%)  cargo_llvm_lines::count_lines

    422 (1.4%)      2 (0.2%)  alloc::slice::merge

    366 (1.2%)      5 (0.5%)  core::option::Option<T>::map
    304 (1.0%)      6 (0.5%)  alloc::alloc::box_free
    296 (1.0%)      4 (0.4%)  core::result::Result<T,E>::map_err
    295 (1.0%)      1 (0.1%)  cargo_llvm_lines::wrap_args
    291 (0.9%)      1 (0.1%)  core::char::methods::<impl char>::encode_utf8
    286 (0.9%)      1 (0.1%)  cargo_llvm_lines::run_cargo_rustc
    284 (0.9%)      4 (0.4%)  core::option::Option<T>::ok_or_else
```

## Avoid Procedural Macro Crates

Procedural macros are the hot sauce of Rust development: they burn through CPU
cycles so use with care (keyword: monomorphization).

If you heavily use procedural macros in your project (e.g., if you use serde),
you can try to sidestep their impact on compile times with
[watt](https://github.com/dtolnay/watt), a tool that offloads macro compilation
to Webassembly.

From the docs:

> By compiling macros ahead-of-time to Wasm, we save all downstream users of the
> macro from having to compile the macro logic or its dependencies themselves.
>
> Instead, what they compile is a small self-contained Wasm runtime (~3 seconds,
> shared by all macros) and a tiny proc macro shim for each macro crate to hand
> off Wasm bytecode into the Watt runtime (~0.3 seconds per proc-macro crate you
> depend on). This is much less than the 20+ seconds it can take to compile
> complex procedural macros and their dependencies.

Note that this crate is still experimental.

(Oh, and did I mention that both, `watt` and `cargo-llvm-lines` were built by
[David Tolnay](https://github.com/dtolnay/), who is a frickin' steamroller of an
engineer?)

## Compile On A Beefy Machine

On portable devices, compiling can drain your battery and be slow. To avoid
that, I'm using my machine at home, a 6-core AMD FX 6300 with 12GB RAM, as a
build machine. I can use it in combination with [Visual Studio Code Remote
Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).

If you don't have a dedicated machine yourself, you can compile in the cloud
instead.  
[Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/) is superb for testing a cloud build as they
provide you with a beefy machine (currently 16 core Intel Xeon 2.30GHz, 60GB
RAM) for free during a limited period. Simply add `https://gitpod.io/#` in
front of any Github repository URL.
[Here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hello-rust/show/tree/master/episode/9)
is an example for one of my [Hello Rust](https://hello-rust.show/) episodes.

When it comes to buying dedicated hardware,
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/chqu4c/building_a_computer_for_fastest_possible_rust/)
are some tips. Generally, you should get a proper multicore CPU like an AMD
Ryzen Threadripper plus at least 32 GB of RAM.

## Drastic Measures: Overclock Your CPU? üî•

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: You can damage your hardware if you don't know what you are doing.
Proceed at your own risk.

Here's an idea for the desperate. Now I don't recommend that to everyone, but
if you have a standalone desktop computer with a decent CPU, this might be a way
to squeeze out the last bits of performance.

Even though the Rust compiler executes a lot of steps in parallel,
single-threaded performance is still quite relevant.

As a somewhat drastic measure, you can try to overclock your CPU. [Here's a
tutorial for my processor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb1QDpRnOvw). (I owe
you some benchmarks from my machine.)

## Download ALL The Crates

If you have a slow internet connection, a big part of the initial build
process is fetching all those shiny crates from crates.io. To mitigate that,
you can download **all** crates in advance to cache them locally.
[criner](https://github.com/the-lean-crate/criner) does just that:

```
git clone https://github.com/the-lean-crate/criner
cd criner
cargo run --release -- mine
```

The archive size is surprisingly reasonable, with roughly 50GB of required disk
space.

## Help Others: Upload Leaner Crates For Faster Build Times

[`cargo-diet`](https://github.com/the-lean-crate/cargo-diet) helps you build
lean crates that significantly reduce download size (sometimes by 98%). It might
not directly affect your own build time, but your users will surely be thankful. üòä

## What's Next?

Phew! That was a long list. If you have any additional tips, please [let me know](https://github.com/mre/mre.github.io/issues).

If compiler performance is something you're interested in, why not [collaborate
on a tool](https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/issues/51) to see what user code is causing rustc to use lots of
time?

Also, once you're done optimizing your build times, how about optimizing
runtime next? My friend [Pascal Hertleif](https://twitter.com/killercup/) has a
[nice article](https://deterministic.space/high-performance-rust.html) on that.
