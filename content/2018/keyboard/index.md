title="Switching from a German to a US Keyboard Layout - Is It Worth It?"

For the first three decades of my life, I've used a German keyboard layout.
A few months ago, I switched to a US layout.
This post summarizes my thoughts around the topic.
I was looking for a similar article before jumping the gun, but I couldn't find one &mdash; so I'll try to fill this gap.

## Why switch?

I was reasonably efficient when writing prose, but felt like 
a lemur on a piano when programming: reaching the special keys (`{`, `;`, or `/`)
required lots of finger-stretching.

Here's [Wikipedia's polite
explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout) why the
German keyboard sucks for programming:

> Like many other non-American keyboards, German keyboards change the right Alt
> key into an <b>Alt Gr key to access a third level</b> of key assignments. This is
> necessary because the umlauts and some other special characters leave no room
> to have all the special symbols of ASCII, needed by programmers among others,
> available on the first or second (shifted) levels without unduly increasing
> the size of the keyboard.

## Why switch **now**?

After many years of using a rubber-dome [Logitech Cordless Desktop
Wave](https://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/cordless-desktop-wave/), I
had to get a mechanical keyboard again. 

Those rubber domes just feel too mushy to me now. In addition to that, I enjoy the
clicky sound of a mechanical keyboard and the noticeable tactile bump. (I'm using
[Cherry MX Brown Keys](https://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/) with [O-Ring dampeners](https://www.howtogeek.com/293659/how-to-quiet-your-mechanical-keyboard-with-switch-dampeners/) to contain the anger of my coworkers.)

Most mechanical keyboards come with an ANSI US layout only, so I figured, I'd
finally make the switch.

## How long did it take to get accustomed to the new layout?

Working as a Software Engineer, my biggest fear was, that the switch would slow
down my daily work. This turned out not to be true. I was reasonably productive
from day one and nobody even noticed any difference. (That's a good thing,
right?)

At first, I didn't like the *bar-shaped US-Return key*. I preferred the European
layout with a *vertical enter key*. I was afraid that I would hit the key by
accident. After a while, I find that the US return key to be even more convenient. 
I never hit it by accident.

Within two weeks, I was back to 100% typing speed.

## Did my programming speed improve noticeably?

Yup.

Especially when using special characters (`/`, `;`, `{`, and so on) I'm much
faster now; partly because the key locations feel more intuitive, but mainly
because my fingers stay at their dedicated positions now.

Somehow the position of special characters feels right. I can now understand the
reason why Vim is using `/` for search or why the pipe symbol is `|`: both are
easy to reach! It all makes sense now!
(For a fun time, try that on a German keyboard!)  

I now understand why Mircosoft chose `\` as a directory separator: it's easily
accessible from a US keyboard. On the German layout, it's&hellip; just&hellip; awful
(`Alt Gr`+`ß` on Windows, `Shift` + `Option` + `7` on Mac).

The opening curly brace on a German layout Mac is produced with `Alt`+`8`, which
always made me leave the [home
row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing#Home_row) and break my typing
flow. Now there are dedicated keys for parentheses. Such a relief!

## Am I slower when writing German texts now?

In the beginning, I was.

Somehow my brain associated the German layout with German
texts. First, I used the macOS layout switcher.
This turned out to be cumbersome and take time.

Then I found the "[US with Umlauts via Option Key
Layout](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/usgermankeyboard)". It works perfectly fine for
me. It allows me to use a single Keyboard layout but insert German umlauts at will
(e.g. ö is `Option`+`o`). There is probably a similar layout for other language combinations.

## Is switching between keyboards painful?

{{ figure(src="./KB_United_States.svg", caption="US keyboard layout" credits="[Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States.svg)") }}

My built-in MacBook Pro keyboard layout is still German. I was afraid, that switching between
the internal German and the external English keyboard would confuse me. This
turned out not to be a problem. I rarely look at the print anyway.

## Summary

If you consider switching, just do it. I don't look back at all.
