My first computer was a Vobis Highscreen Big Tower with a 16 MHz 386SX.
I managed to get Windows 95 running on it, which took 50 out of the available 60 MB of
disk space. Booting Win95 took around 30 minutes on that machine; it was glorious.
Eventually I fried it when I flipped the voltage switch from 230V to 115V while it was running.

I fried a few more computers, but I also helped fix some. I learned how to
configure routers and set up networks before I had internet access, because
we used to have print magazines with articles about how to do that,
and people paid money to get them online.

As a kid living up on a mountain with no internet, the only programming language
I had access to was QBASIC because it came pre-installed with the OS, including the documentation.
I learned to program by brute force, typing in commands and seeing what
happened.
The first game I wrote was an Asteroids clone, but I didn't know what arrays were,
so all asteroids had hardcoded names in the program.
Later, I wrote a table tennis game for two players with nice graphics and double-buffering, but
when I reinstalled the operating system, I forgot to save it to a floppy disk.
Those were the days.

This is also around the time I started to have my own blog.
I've been maintaining some form of personal website for more than 25 years now. Some of the [different versions](https://github.com/mre/endler.dev) are still available on GitHub and the Internet Archive.

My first Linux distribution was Aurox, as it came with one of these magazines.
After that, I was a proud Slackware user for a few years and managed to break my kernel and boot loader on a regular basis,
as was customary in those days.
The first version of my penguin logo dates back to that time, too.

My [first company](https://web.archive.org/web/20111128060819/http://www.ebit-systems.de/) was a small software consultancy that I founded with my friend Johannes.
We fixed hardware, created websites, and wrote simple applications for mid-sized companies in the region.

Later on, I studied Computer Science at [Universit&auml;t Bayreuth] and started to contribute to open-source software.
After graduating, I went on to work as a backend engineer at [trivago], where I
mostly dealt with website performance and scaling our backend systems. 

I learned many programming languages throughout the years, but ever since I learned of Rust in 2015, I've been using it as my main programming language.
In 2021, I founded [corrode](https://corrode.dev), a consulting company that helps teams
make the most of Rust.

I usually go by my handle `mre` on the internet, which is short for "Matthias Richard Endler".
You can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mre), [Twitter], [LinkedIn], [Stack Overflow], and [GitHub].
Here is a list of my [public speaking][talks] engagements.
