I'm a Backend Developer / Site Reliability Engineer living in Düsseldorf, Germany.

My interests are scalability, performance and distributed systems;
but I also play around with embedded systems and console emulation.
I have a master's degree in Computer Science from [Universit&auml;t Bayreuth].
At work, I improve the backend infrastructure of [trivago] by making it
faster and more reliable.

Nowadays, I mostly use _Golang_, _Python_, and _Rust_ to get stuff done.
I run [*Hello, Rust!*], a YouTube channel about the Rust programming
language.

Here's a list of some Open Source projects I maintain:
