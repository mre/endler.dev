      <p>
        I'm <a href="/about">Matthias Endler</a>, an open-source maintainer and
        Rust consultant at <a href="https://corrode.dev">corrode</a>, helping
        clients make their Rust code faster and more idiomatic.

        I am the co-founder of

        podcast analytics (like Google Analytics, but for podcasts).
      </p>
      <p>
        With a passion for linters and static code analysis, I also maintain
        <a href="https://analysis-tools.dev/">analysis-tools.dev</a>, an open
        platform with 600+ tools listed.
      </p>

        about the Rust programming language and

      <p>
        Some links on this blog are <i>affiliate links</i> and I earn a small
        comission if you end up buying something on the partner site (at no
        extra cost for you), which I use to cover maintenance costs. I only link
        to books and resources that I'd personally recommend to friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintaining this blog and my projects is a lot of work and I'd love to
        spend a bigger part of my life writing and maintaining open source
        projects. If you like to support me in this goal, the best way would be
        to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mre/">become a sponsor</a> ❤️.
