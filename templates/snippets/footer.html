            <p>
                I'm a Backend Engineer running <i><a href="https://hello-rust.show/">Hello, Rust!</a></i>, a YouTube
                channel about the Rust
                programming language.
                On this blog, you'll mostly find articles about programming in
                <a href="/2017/yes/">Rust</a> and <a href="/2018/go-io-testing/">Golang</a> or developer tools like <a
                    href="/2017/makefiles/">make</a> and <a href="/2018/ten-years-of-vim/">Vim</a>. We should hang out
                some
                time.
                It'll be great.<br />

            <p>
                Creating and maintaining this blog and my projects is a lot of
                work. By supporting me, you allow me to invest more time in new
                content, new features, and continuous maintenance. The best way
                to support me is to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mre/">sponsor me on GitHub</a>.
                GitHub will even match sponsorships until October 2020!
                Alternatively, I also have <a
                href="https://www.patreon.com/hellorust">Patreon</a> account. Thank you! ❤️
