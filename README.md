# Hello!

![Build Status](https://github.com/mre/mre.github.io/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is the source of my personal website built with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

## History

I'm maintaining _some_ kind of blog since around 20 years (I'm a bit shocked myself).
The first versions are lost in time. Actually no, I still got backups which I'm too shy to upload.
The Internet Archive started indexing my page somewhere around 2005 and [that's glorious](https://web.archive.org/web/20050203114107/http://www.matthias-endler.de/).
