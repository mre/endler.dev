# Hello!

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mre/endler.dev/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mre/endler.dev/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is the source code of [my personal website](https://endler.dev). I write about Rust, open-source maintenance, side projects, and business ideas.

## History

I'm maintaining _some_ kind of blog for around 20 years now (I'm a bit shocked
myself). The first versions are lost in time. Actually, no, I still got backups
which I'm too shy to upload. The Internet Archive started indexing my page
somewhere around 2005 and [that's
glorious](https://web.archive.org/web/20050203114107/http://www.matthias-endler.de/).
